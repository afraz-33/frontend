          "item3": "Combination insurance: This policy combines the advantages of capital and in-kind insurance.

Without insurance, these costs have to be paid from your own resources or inheritance, which can be a big financial burden for many families. In addition to the financial worries, your next of kin will also have to deal with all the practical matters. This can be overwhelming, especially during an emotional time. Without clear guidelines or insurance, organising the funeral can become an arduous task. Funeral insurance not only provides financial security, but also ensures that many organisational aspects of the funeral are already taken care of."
